# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Python
This project showcases a comprehensive healthcare dataset analysis, including data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, time series analysis, and the creation of interactive visualizations using Python libraries like pandas,pyspan ,matploltlib and Plotly.
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of a healthcare dataset, including data cleaning, generating descriptive statistics, and visualizing key insights. The project involves the use of various Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and creating interactive graphs.

## Benefits to the Industry
This project can help healthcare organizations analyze patient data efficiently, leading to better decision-making and resource management. By cleaning and visualizing patient data, healthcare providers can monitor trends in admissions, medical conditions, billing, and more. The interactive graphs created using Plotly can offer dynamic insights that go beyond static reporting.

## Python Libraries Used:
- **Pyspan**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive graphs and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For handling and analyzing the dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations.

## Key Features:
- Data Cleaning: Removed decimals from certain columns and handled missing values.
- Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Explored the relationship between multiple variables such as age, medical conditions, and billing amount.
- Time Series Analysis: Analyzed trends in patient admissions over time.
- Outlier Handling: Demonstrated the impact of removing outliers during the analysis.
- Interactive Graphs: Used Plotly to create interactive visualizations for deeper insights.

## Target Audience:
- Data Analysts and Scientists working in healthcare.
- Professionals interested in data visualization and storytelling.
- Beginner and intermediate Python users looking to learn through practical examples.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed or u can also run it on google colab.
3. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Open the `.ipynb` notebook file and run the cells step-by-step.

## Conclusion:
This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of data analysis and visualization techniques using Python, and it offers valuable insights for healthcare professionals. It also contributes to my learning journey as a Data Analyst, building a strong portfolio on GitHub.
